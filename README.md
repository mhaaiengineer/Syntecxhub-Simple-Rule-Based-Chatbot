# Simple Rule-Based Chatbot 
The Simple Rule-Based Chatbot is a Python-based console application that simulates human conversation using predefined rules and pattern matching. It supports greetings, help commands, and basic domain-specific questions through a small knowledge base. The chatbot interacts via CLI and logs conversation history for reference.

This project matches the "Simple Rule-Based Chatbot" requirements:
- Conversational bot using pattern matching (rule-based)
- Supports intents (greeting, help, small talk) and rule responses
- Includes a small knowledge base to answer domain questions
- Interactive via console
- Logs conversation history to a file

## Files
- chatbot.py               -> main chatbot program
- knowledge_base.json      -> small domain Q&A (edit to add more)
- conversation_history.txt -> created/updated when you run the bot

## Run
Keep `chatbot.py` and `knowledge_base.json` in the same folder, then run:

python chatbot.py
